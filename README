This project is a custom remake of the BGnet model by Hahn and McIntyre. It was
remade to increase compatibility with the nrntraub model code structure, with
the end goal of connecting the two together to create a more realistic model of
the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. This is still a tentative model,
and should not be assumed to be a fully operational model. It will contain
errors.
